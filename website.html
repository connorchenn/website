<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt; History of Dogs &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; Dogs are members of the family Canidae. Canids are part of a larger group called Carnivora, which also includes bears, cats and seals. Fossils show us that Canidae split off from the common ancestors of Carnivora about 40 million years ago. From about 15 million years ago, we can subdivide Canidae into three subgroups: fox-like animals, wolf-like animals and South American canids, such as the maned wolf and crab-eating fox. Members of the wolf-like group include wolves, coyotes and jackals, which are all closely related. &lt;/p1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;Dogs are very cool. They are very nice. You can adopt one.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt; Dogs Nowdays &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; Today, dogs are such familiar parts of our lives—our reputed best friends and subject of many a meme—that it’s easy to take them, and what they represent, for granted. Dogs were the first domesticated animals, and their barks heralded the Anthropocene. We raised puppies well before we raised kittens or chickens; before we herded cows, goats, pigs, and sheep; before we planted rice, wheat, barley, and corn; before we remade the world. &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt; What to expect &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; When the time comes to finally bring your new puppy home for the first time, you can pretty much count on three things: unbridled joy, cleaning up your puppy’s accidents, and a major lifestyle adjustment. As you’ll soon learn, a growing puppy needs much more than a food bowl and a doghouse to thrive. And while it may be a lot of work initially, it’s well worth the effort. Establishing good and healthy habits in those first few sleep-deprived weeks will lay the foundation for many dog-years of happiness for you and your puppy. &lt;/p1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt; What to look out for &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;img src=https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2799859/size/tmg-article_default_mobile.jpg&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; Many symptoms can determine if a dog is sick. Make sure to look out for: lack of appetite, poor weight gain, vomiting, swollen of painful abdomen, lethargy (tiredness), diarrhea, difficulty breathing, wheezing or coughing, pale gums, swollen, red eyes or eye discharge, nasal discharge, inability to pass urine or stool &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt; Need some good dog names? &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; Here are some good examples: Max, Charlie, Cooper, Buddy, Jack, Rocky, Oliver, Bear, Duke, Tucker, Bella, Lucy, Daisy, Luna, Lola, Sadie, Molly, Maggie, Bailey, Sophie &lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt; Did you know? &lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; Petting a dog can lower your blood pressure &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; The average body temperature of a dog is 101.2 degrees &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; The US has the highest dog population in the world &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; 3 dogs survived the titanic! &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; A dog's whisker's are used as sensing devices &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; A dog's smell is 10,000 times better than a humans &lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt; Dogs sweat through their pads &lt;/p&gt;</p>
